        <h3>About us and more info</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We are a small group of people who make a living by 
hacking various password-protected files and, most recently, mainly 
crypto wallets. People I simply pay for breaking passwords to a file or 
wallet. We will then sell it at our own price.</li>
            <li>Recently, we received a set of unbroken wallets (.dat 
files) from one person. We bought them with the feeling that we would be
 able to break them. And we did it! We now have several hundred coins in
 our account.</li>
            <li>We have now decided to do a good deed. Unfortunately, we
 are not able to spend that much money, so we sell a few wallets for a 
fraction of the price and donate this money to the person from whom we 
bought the wallets as a thank you.</li>
            <li>All wallets have 50 BTC and a source of money directly 
from Coinbase. So they do not come from illegal activities and can be 
used anywhere without fear. Their use will be completely legal!</li>
            <li>We sell wallets for 0.5% of their price! Wallets that we
 have already sold are not on the list to protect the new owner. 
Currently, only the last 30 of the 112 wallets remain.</li>
            <li>We do not want to display our email publicly for 
everyone here. We have enough work and we don't need every visitor to 
write to us that they want to hack something. But don't worry. If you 
are really interested, buy a wallet and our email will be displayed on 
the payment page after payment. Then you can email us your request or 
just thank you for the money almost for free.</li>
            <li>Please enable javascripts. We only use it to check BTC 
payments. This will allow us to publish a hash to the file through which
 the wallet can be downloaded. Thank you.</li>
